DONE Keep last observation for calculating median followup
DONE Compared VN vs MonthsFromBaseline in QIC
DONE Identified covariate that changed BCF association
DONE Added another figure of adj with and without waist to manuscript
DONE Changed monthsfrombaseline to yearsfrombaseline in GEE models
DONE Added interaction with time, sex, ethnicity unadjusted results in Results
DONE Created plots to view interaction with time in a vignette
TODO Moved interaction plot to seer, used seer function instead
DONE Included sensitivity analysis based on sex
TODO Included sensitivity analysis with covariates as time-independent
DONE Switched GEE fig labels to top
DONE Created and added PLS fig (using HOMA2)
