DONE Used MonthsFromBaseline rather than VN for GEE
DONE Used HOMA2 instead of HOMA-IR
DONE Confirmed/fixed that incident diabetes cases were not used in GEE
DONE Included as first model time interaction in QIC/GEE
DONE Keep last observation for calculating median followup
DONE Compared VN vs MonthsFromBaseline in QIC
TODO Identified covariate that changed BCF association
DONE Changed monthsfrombaseline to yearsfrombaseline in GEE models
TODO Added interaction with time, sex, ethnicity unadjusted results
DONE Included sensitivity analysis based on sex
TODO Included sensitivity analysis with covariates as time-independent
DONE Switched GEE fig labels to top
DONE Created and added PLS fig (using HOMA2)
TODO Created and added GEE fig with PLS scores
DONE Fix outcomes in heatmap and add axis tilt
DONE Created and added heatmap fig (with just TAGFA)
TODO Created and added heatmap fig using mol%
TODO Created and added PLS fig of beta-cell function

DONE Included DAG (from DAGitty) as Supplement
DONE Included/fixed QIC table
TODO Included Basic characteristic table in main with p-value
DONE Included number of participants with 1, 2, 3 visits
