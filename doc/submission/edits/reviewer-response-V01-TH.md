Hi Luke,

Fantastic start on the responses - I've made a couple of very minor suggestions (attached).   Also:

- For the final version we'll want to list the line and page numbers where the changes have been made;
- In general, the response needs a bit more groveling!  ("thank you for this excellent suggestion" ...  bla bla);

Overall, great work.  I'll dive into the next version whenever you send it along.
