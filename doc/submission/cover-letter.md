Dear Dr. Ginsberg,

Attached please find the revision of our previously submitted manuscript (JLR/2018/084970) entitled, "Clusters of fatty acids in the serum triacylglyceride fraction associate with the disorders of type 2 diabetes". The work is original and has not been previously published nor is it under consideration for publication elsewhere.

We'd like to thank the editors and the reviewers for their thorough and insightful review of our manuscript. We have been able to make the vast majority of the suggested revisions, which we feel has improved the manuscript considerably. Below we present a point-by-point response to each of the editors' and reviewers'  comments.

The preprint of this manuscript was uploaded to bioRxiv (DOI link: https://doi.org/10.1101/279703).

Thank you for considering our revised manuscript and please do not hesitate to contact me for additional information.

Sincerely,

Anthony Hanley
