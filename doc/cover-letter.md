Dear Drs Dennis and Smith,

Attached please find the submission of our manuscript entitled, "Clusters of fatty acids in the serum triacylglyceride fraction associate with the disorders of type 2 diabetes". The work is original and has not been previously published nor is it under consideration for publication elsewhere.

Our manuscript describes results from a longitudinal cohort of individuals at risk for diabetes, with data from over 6 years of follow-up. In the present paper, we found that a cluster of four fatty acids in the serum triacylglyceride lipid fraction longitudinally associated strongly with insulin resistance and moderately with beta-cell dysfunction. These four fatty acids (14:0, 16:0, 14:1 n-7, and 16:1 n-7) also correlated highly with higher clinically measured triglycerides. Given these results, in addition to the broad spectrum of fatty acids and the detailed longitudinal metabolic measures presented, we believe these results would be of interest to readers of the Journal of Lipid Research.

We have posted a preprint of this manuscript to bioRxiv (manuscript number: BIORXIV/2018/279703).

Thank you for considering our revised manuscript and please do not hesitate to contact me for additional information.

Sincerely,

Anthony Hanley
