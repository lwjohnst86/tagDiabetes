Note: keep the story simple and clean, without getting too dense

- Run PLS with just those FA that loaded strongly to see the predictive ability.
- SA with/without NEFA
- SA with/without WC
- Interactions of VN unadjusted

Outline:

- Primary analysis:
    - Look over medications, how they influence the TAGFA
    - GEE
        - SA for the large outlier for the TAGFA (see dist plot)
        - Include # of both uncorrected and corrected (FDR) significant associations
        - QIC modeling
        - DAG development
        - Look over the entire model (see which variables are significant, etc)
        - Sensitivity analysis with Carb intake? And with adiponectin? (which is
        involved in TAG metabolism)
    - PLS with ISI and HOMA-IR
        - Use extracted PLS components in GEE (?)
- Secondary analysis:
    - AROC
        - dysgly with clinical TAG vs the 'best' fatty acid to compare to
        
- Make sure to include comments from NEFA paper
- Add stats to basic char table... (don't really want to. But I should ..?)
        
Possible interpretations:

- muscle IR -> higher TAG
- But longitudinal, since no interaction with time, so maybe the higher TAG is
because of higher IR (since this population is at risk of being IR).

# Abstract

# Background

Hypertriglyceridemia is an established and well known factor involved in the
dysregulation of metabolic function and subsequent negative health impacts. It
is a component of the metabolic syndrome {{ cite }}, a strong risk factor for
cardiovascular disease {{cite}}, and can contribute to worsening pathogenesis of
diabetes through it's harmful health effects {{ clarify }}. Triacylglcerol (TAG)
is a common blood measure taken during routine clinical visits and has {{
historically?}} been a target of pharmaceutical intervention {{cite}}, though evidence on
the {{efficacy? effectiveness?}} of such interventions are often underwhelming
on their effects on disease {{risk?}} reduction {{cite}}.

TAG as a pharmaceutical target and as a measure of metabolic health is a single
measure of all fatty acids within the TAG fraction. However, given the 
increasing appreciation for the role of the specific fatty acid (FA) composition
of various blood lipid fractions on health outcomes, reducing the complex FA 
metabolism within the TAG fraction to a single measure may contribute to the 
less than expected {{?}} changes in risk reduction.

In additiona, the {{interplay?}} between TAG and IR is complex and has the
potential to act as a {{feed forward?}} loop. Greater resistance to insulin,
particularly in the liver, can result in greater accumulation of hepatic fat and
a potential associated increased production in TAG which are secreted into
circulation with VLDL [@Yu2012a] {{review on mechanisms of TAG, IR, etc.}} {{not
always the case, dependent on ethnicity}}. However, higher circulating TAG can
exacerbate or contribute to insulin resistance in various tissues, creating a
vicious cycle {{cite}}. Few studies have been conducted that have examined the
longitudinal effect of TAGFA composition on diabetes pathophysiology.

Several prospective studies have identified to date the association of 
hypertriglyceridemia on incident diabetes {{[@Chien2008a; @DAgostino2004a;
@Schulze2009a]}}, but no longitudinal studies have been conducted{{another 
word?}} on the pathophysiological factors underlying diabetes.

Our objective was to examine the longitudinal role of the specific composition
of the serum TAG fraction on OGTT-derived measures of insulin sensitivity and
beta-cell function in an Canadian population at risk for diabetes over 6 years.

Recruitment for the baseline visit of the Prospective Metabolism and Islet Cell Evaluation (PROMISE) 
cohort took place between 2004-2006 from London and Toronto, 
Canada. Individuals were selected to participant if they met the eligibility 
criteria of having one or more risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
including obesity, hypertension, family history of diabetes, and/or a history of
gestational diabetes or birth of a macrosomic infant. A total of 736 individuals
attended the baseline visit. Subsequent examinations occurred every three years,
with three examination visits completed to date (2004-2006, 2007-2009, and
2010-2013). Participants are contacted annually by telephone. The current study
sample used data on participants who did not have diabetes at baseline, who
returned for one or more of the follow-up examinations, and who had samples
available for fatty acid measurements (n=477; see the CONSORT diagram in 
`r cite_sf('consort')`; a total of `r calc_n_for_visits()[1]` attended all three
visits). Metabolic characterization, anthropometric
measurements, and questionnaires on lifestyle and sociodemographics are
collected at each examination visit. Research ethics approval was obtained from
Mount Sinai Hospital and the University of Western Ontario, and all participants
provided written informed consent. Data collection methods were standardized
across the 2 centres and research nurses were centrally trained.

## Metabolic characterization

Participants completed an 8-12 hour 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 
each examination visit, with blood samples taken during fasting, 30 min, and 2 hr 
post-glucose load. Samples were subsequently processed and frozen at -70°C.
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was measured using standard laboratory 
procedures. Cholesterol, HDL, and clinically-measured triacylglycerides (TAG) 
were measured using Roche Modular's enzymatic colorimetric tests (Mississauga, 
ON).  Both insulin and glucose were derived from the OGTT at fasting, 30 minute,
and 2 hour time points. Specific insulin was measured with the Elecsys 1010 
(Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) immunoassay analyzer and 
electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, which shows 0.05% cross-reactivity to 
intact human pro-insulin and the Des 31,32 circulating split form (Linco Res. 
Inc) and has a coefficient of variation (CV) of 9.3%. Glucose was determined 
using an enzymatic hexokinase (Roche Modular, Roche Diagnostics) with a 
detection range of 0.11 to 41.6 mmol/L and an inter-assay %CV of <1.1% and an
intra-assay %CV of < 1.9%.  All assays were performed at the Banting and Best
Diabetes Centre Core Lab at Mt Sinai Hospital. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG),
impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and diabetes were categorized using the 2006
WHO criteria [@WHO2006].

TAGFA composition was quantified using stored fasting serum samples from the 
baseline visit, which had been frozen at -70°C for 4-6 years and had not been 
exposed to any freeze-thaw cycles. Serum fatty acids have been documented to be 
stable at these temperatures for up to 10 years [@Matthan2010a]. A known amount 
of {{ confirm with Richard the correct name}} heptadecanoic acid (17:0) was added as an internal
standard prior to extracting total lipids according to the method of Folch 
[@Folch1957a]. Each serum lipid fraction---non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), 
cholesteryl ester, phospholipid, and TAGFA---was isolated using thin layer 
chromatography. Fatty acid methyl esters were separated and quantified using a 
Varian-430 gas chromatograph (Varian, Lake Forest, CA, USA) equipped with a 
Varian Factor Four capillary column and a flame ionization detector. Fatty acid 
concentrations (nmol/ml) were calculated by proportional comparison of gas
chromatography peak areas to that of the internal standards [@Nishi2014a]. There
were 22 fatty acids measured in the TAGFA fraction. Given that each lipid
fraction differs in biology and given the complexity of the analyses, findings
for other lipid fractions in this cohort are reported separately (see ref
@Johnston2016a for the analysis of the phospholipid and cholesteryl ester
fractions). 
<!--and {{next citation}} for the analysis of the NEFA fraction).-->

## Anthropometrics and sociodemographics

Height, weight, and waist circumference (WC) were measured at all clinic 
examinations using standard procedures.  WC was measured at the natural waist, 
defined as the narrowest part of the torso between the umbilicus and the xiphoid
process. BMI was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by height (m) squared.
Questionnaires administered at each examination determined sociodemographics.
A version of the Modifiable Activity Questionnaire (MAQ) [@Kriska1990]
determined estimated physical activity. The MAQ collects information on leisure
and occupational activity, including intensity, frequency, and duration, over
the past year. Each reported activity from the MAQ was weighted by its
metabolic intensity allowing for the estimation of MET-hours per week.

## Variable calculation and statistical analysis

Insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function indices were computed using the OGTT 
glucose and insulin data. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using HOMA2-%S
[@Levy1998a] using the HOMA2 Calculator and the Insulin Sensitivity Index (ISI)
[@Matsuda1999]. HOMA largely reflects hepatic insulin resistance, while ISI
reflects whole-body insulin sensitivity [@AbdulGhani2007]. Beta-cell function
was assessed using the Insulinogenic Index [@Wareham1995] over HOMA-IR [@Matthews1985] (IGI/IR)
and the Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2) [@Retnakaran2009]. IGI/IR
is a measure of the first phase of insulin secretion while ISSI-2 is analogous to
the disposition index (but using OGTT values). Each index has been validated
against gold standard measures [@Matthews1985; @Hermans1999a; @Matsuda1999; @Retnakaran2009].
Specific formulas for each OGTT-derived measure can be found in the {{
Supplementary Material }}.

The primary outcome variables for this analysis were HOMA2-%S, ISI, IGI/IR, and
ISSI-2, which were log-transformed for the statistical modeling. The primary
predictor variables for this analysis were 22 individual TAGFA as mole percent
(mol%) of the total fraction and as concentration (nmol/mL). Clinically-measured
TAG is also included as a primary predictor to serve as a comparison against the
TAGFA composition. A limitation with the clinically-measured TAG is that it was
only quantified on a portion of the participants at the 6-year visit (n = `r n_tag`).
Pearson correlation coefficients were computed to assess the relationships of
individual TAGFA with other continuous variables. Correlations were also
computed for TAGFA against each other, followed by using hierarchical clustering
analysis to identify clusters within the correlation matrix of the TAGFA
composition.

Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models [@Zeger1986a] were used in the
primary analysis to determine the longitudinal associations between the outcome
variables and the predictor variables. Given the longitudinal design, an
auto-regressive of order 1 (AR1) working correlation matrix was chosen for the GEE
models as it had the best model fit when assessed using quasi-likelihood
information criteria (QIC), though other matrices (eg. exchangeable)
had similar fit (data not shown). GEE is well suited to longitudinal cohort 
studies given it's capacity to handle missed visits. The predictor variables and
continuous covariates were scaled (mean-centered and standardized). The TAGFA,
total NEFA, sex, ethnicity, and baseline age were classified as 
*time-independent* (held constant) as they were measured only at the baseline 
visit or do not change throughout the study, while the outcome variables and 
remaining covariates were set as *time-dependent*. No imputation was conducted 
on missing values. Given how the samples for TAGFA measurement were determined
and how the outcome variables are calculated, cases of diabetes at baseline and
followup were not included in the GEE modeling.

Covariates were selected based on the previous literature, from directed acyclic
graph [@Greenland1999a] recommendations (see `r cite_f('dag_is')` and `r cite_f('dag_bcf')`), and from 
QIC. `r cite_t('tab_qic')` shows the covariates compared using QIC.
While the final GEE model selected as best fitting differed between insulin
sensitivity and beta-cell function measures, the differences in QIC values were
less than 10 between many of the models, suggesting similar fit. As such, we selected
the model that had the fewest covariates and that had similar fit between the
outcome measures ({{##}}). The final GEE model was adjusted for {{covariates}}.
After scaling, log-transforming, and exponentiating, the GEE estimates are 
interpreted as an expected percent difference in the outcome variable for every 
standard deviation (SD) increase in the predictor variable given the covariates 
are held constant (including time). Lastly for the GEE models, we tested for an interaction with 
sex, ethnicity, or time by the predictor term for each outcome variable.

While GEE accounts for the longitudinal design of the data, this approach is 
limited in that it cannot analyze the inherent multivariate nature of the 
composition of the TAGFA fraction. To confirm the GEE results in a multivariate 
environment (all TAGFA), partial least squares regression (PLS) was
used to identify the patterns of TAGFA composition against insulin sensitivity
and beta-cell function. No prevalent diabetes cases were included in the PLS
analysis. For more detailed explanation of GEE and PLS, please see the
{{supplemental}} Methods.

All analyses were performed using R `r getRversion()` [@Rbase], along with the R
packages geepack `r packageVersion('geepack')` for GEE [@Hoejsgaard2006a] and pls
`r packageVersion('pls')` for PLS. The R code and extra analyses for
this manuscript is available at {{code doi}}. Results were considered
statistically significance at p<0.05, after adjusting for multiple testing using
the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate [@Benjamini1995a]. STROBE was used
as a guideline for reporting [@Vandenbroucke2007b].

# Results

## Basic characteristics of the PROMISE cohort

`r cite_t('tab_basic')` shows some basic characteristics of the PROMISE cohort. The mean 
follow-up time was `r calc_followup_time()`, where `r calc_pct_full_visits()`%
of participants attended all three visits. There were
`r female$npct` females and `r euro$npct` who had European-ancestry, with a mean
age in years of `r aide::ave_sd(ds0yr$Age)` and a mean BMI
of `r aide::ave_sd(ds0yr$BMI)`. Given the eligibility criteria, the majority of
participants (`r fhd$npct`) had a family history of diabetes.
Between the baseline visit and the 6-year visit in this sample, insulin
sensitivity and beta-cell function measures had a significant median decline
between `r outcome_chg$chg` (p`r outcome_chg$p` from GEE; n=`r outcome_chg$n`). There 
were `r dys$dm` and `r dys$pre` incident cases of diabetes and
pre-diabetes (IFG and IGT), respectively. 

`r cite_f('fig_tagfa')` shows the composition of each FA in the TAG fraction (see 
`r cite_t('tab_tagfa')` for a tabular presentation of the values). 
Three TAGFA contributed `r format_rounding(sum(tagfa$pct))`% to the total 
TAG concentration: `r tagfa$c[1]`; `r tagfa$c[2]`; and, `r tagfa$c[3]`.
`r fig_corr` shows a heatmap of the correlation of individual TAGFA with the
outcome variables and several basic characteristics.
As expected, nearly all TAGFA had very strong positive correlations (r=
`r fa_cor$rng$TAG`) with clinically-measured TAG and moderate positive 
correlations with WC (r=`r fa_cor$rng$Waist`). There was also moderate
negative correlations with HDL (r=`r fa_cor$rng$HDL`). For the outcome variables,
the correlations for the insulin sensitivity measures were generally higher 
(HOMA2-%S: r=`r fa_cor$rng['HOMA2-%S']`, ISI: r=`r fa_cor$rng$ISI`) than 
for the beta-cell function measures (all r<0.30).

## Generalized estimating equation models

There were `r nrow(dplyr::filter(gee_unadj_df, p.value <= 0.05))` FDR-corrected 
significant associations in the unadjusted GEE model (see `r cite_f('fig_gee_unadj')`) and 
`r nrow(dplyr::filter(gee_adj_df, p.value <= 0.05))` FDR-corrected
significant associations in the adjusted GEE model as shown in `r cite_f('fig_gee_adj')`. 
The majority of associations with beta-cell function measures were attenuated
after full model adjustment, while nearly all associations with insulin
sensitivity remained significant. {{ confirm }} Subsequent analysis revealed
that the attenuation with beta-cell function was due primarily to adjustment for
{{ waist? ALT? }}.

As a concentration, nearly all TAGFA had a strong negative association on
HOMA2-%S and ISI (estimates ranging from 
`r est1$outcome_b$rng[3]` and `r est1$outcome_b$rng[7]`, respectively), and a
few had strong negative associations with IGI/IR and ISSI-2 (estimates ranging 
from `r est1$outcome_b$rng[11]` and `r est1$outcome_b$rng[15]`, respectively).
As a mol%, four TAGFA (14:0, 16:0, 14:1n-7, and 16:1n-7) had negative
associations with HOMA2-%S and ISI (between `r est1$outcome_b$rng[1]` and 
`r est1$outcome_b$rng[5]`%, respectively, lower insulin sensitivity for every SD
increase in the TAGFA), while several more TAGFA had positive associations with
HOMA2-%S and ISI (20:0, 18:1n-9, 20:1n-9, 22:1n-9, 18:2n-6, 20:2n-6, 20:4n-6,
and 22:5n-3) predicting between `r est1$outcome_b$rng[2]` and 
`r est1$outcome_b$rng[6]`%, respectively, higher insulin sensitivity for every
SD increase in the TAGFA. One TAGFA, 20:2n-6, had a very strong positive
association with the insulin sensitivity measures, with a `r est1$b_ci$est[1]`
to `r est1$b_ci$est[37]`% higher insulin sensitivity for every SD increase in 
20:2n-6. 

Both clinically-measured TAG and total TAGFA concentration had very strong
negative associations with all outcome variables. There were no significant
interactions by time, sex, or ethnicity for any of the TAGFA (data not shown).
A tabular presentation of the GEE results is shown in `r cite_t("tab_gee_unadj")` 
for unadjusted models and `r cite_t("tab_gee_adj")` for adjusted models.

## Clustering of TAGFA by metabolic measures

To determine which components to use, internal CV showed that the first two
components gave the highest amount of explained variance (data not shown).
Confirming the findings from the GEE models, PLS analysis on the beta-cell
function measures revealed that there was a low correlation (though significant
at p`r cor_pls_igi$p`) between the predicted values and the actual values (r=
`r cor_pls_igi$r` to `r cor_pls_issi2$r`), suggesting poor predictability. While 
the clustering of TAGFA from the PLS results of the beta-cell function measures 
were similar to the insulin sensitivity measures, only the insulin sensitivity 
measures are presented given the higher predictive ability.

The PLS results for the insulin sensitivity (`r cite_f('fig_pls')`) revealed a clustering 
of the FA 14:0, 14:1n-7, 16:0, and 16:1n-7. These TAGFA loaded strongly (meaning
the FA fell between the dashed and solid circles) and negatively on HOMA2-%S
and ISI, suggesting this cluster of TAGFA tracks together with lower insulin
sensitivity. The TAGFA 20:2n-6, 20:5n-3, 22:5n-3, and 22:6n-3 loaded positively
on both insulin sensitivity measures. No other TAGFA loaded strongly, the
results of which remained after running the PLS model on the cross-validated
testing set. The PLS model for insulin sensitivity had good predictive ability, 
determined by correlating the predicted outcome values with the actual values
(HOMA2-%S: `r cor_pls_homa2$r_p`; ISI: `r cor_pls_isi$r_p`).

# Discussion

Outline:

- General findings
- Limitations of study
- Previous lit and limits of those
- How this study fills those gaps and new things learned
- Potential clinical application

We found that in a Canadian population of mainly female and European ancestry, 
the specific TAGFA composition was strongly associated with insulin sensitivity
and moderately associated with beta-cell function. In particular, TAGFA myristic 
acid (14:0), 7-tetradecenoic acid {{ confirm }} (14:1n-7), palmitic acid (16:0),
and palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7) all strongly and negatively predicted lower
insulin sensitivity. While 

Interpretation:

- previous research has shown that CHO intake increases DNL {{ cite }}. In
particular, DNL from CHO sources increases especially the 14-16 chain TAGFA as
well as the 18 chain TAGFA. Prev lit has also shown that higher DNL can increase
risk for DM {{ cite }} and that higher refined CHO can increase risk of DM {{
cite }}. Our study found that the 14-16 TAGFA all strongly predicted lower
insulin sensitivity, reinforcing this finding. While these FA also had a
significant association with beta-cell function, the results were not as strong
as with the IR. {{ why is it that DNL increases risk? }}
- TAGFA that tended to positively associated with IR and BCF also tended to be
the very long chain FA such as eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and
docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3), which have potent anti-inflammatory properties
{{ cite }}. Biologically {{ why these FA and how help with IR }}
- {{ compare models with and without NEFA }} NEFA have been shown contribute
substantially to TAGFA composition and concentration. Adjusting for ...

Limitations:
- While GEE is well suited to longitudinal datasets.. threre is a possibility
given teh complex biology that the temporal associations can not be adequately
analyzed using current methodologies. IN particular, an important issue si taht
we did not quantify TAGFA at each of the three visits and so can not directed
infer changes in TAGFA with changes in IR. However, given potential feedback
between IR and TAGFA, this may in fact be a strength for this particular
association given we are trying to predict how a FA at one time point can
predict future values.
- While PLS is a well-established technique for constructing predictive models
of high dimensionality data strcutures, it can not adjust for potential
confounders and other effect modifiers. Likewise, PLS is not able to handle
longitudinal data so only the baseline visit was used in the PLS analysis.
However, given the limitation, there results are concordant between GEE and PLS
models.
- Our population was predocminiately female and of euro ancestry, who were at 
riskj for diabetes at study enrollment, and as such our results may not be
generalizable to other populations.
- Given the complex biology underlying the variables of interest, there many
some residual confounding we are unaware of or have not been able to adjust for.
However, we have taken extensive precautions for trying to ID confounders
through the DAG models and QIC computations.
- TAGFA may fluctuate daily, but we had participants come in fasted in the morning


[@Barrows2006a] NEFA contributes 60-80% of newly synth VLDL-TAG during fasting
and ~40% during fed. Dietary FA contribute ~25% to newly synth VLDL-TAG.
VLDL-TAG is not cleared (lipolyzed) as much as chylomicron and so stays in
circulation longer (hence why there is bigger TAG pool vs NEFA)


Previous lit and limits:
- A few epidemiological studies have examined the role of the TAGFA composition
on insulin resistance and diabetes risk. 
- A weight loss intervention trial showed that changes in the TAGFA composition
of 19 participants accompanied changes in the weight and insulin sensitivity over
the 33 week period [@Schwab2008a]. Specifically, the TAGFA 14:0, 14:1, 16:0,
16:1, 18:0, 18:3n-3, and 18:3n-6 were all lower after weight loss and correlated
with improved insulin sensitivity.
- In a short (24hr) feeding trial of 24 subjects [@Lee2015a], palmitoleic acid
(16:1n-7) was shown to be strongly correlated with isotopically measured DNL and
was 45% higher in individuals with a greater amount of hepatic fat. However, in
that study only the TAGFA 18:0 was correlated with HOMA-IR, likely due to the
small sample size.
- To our knowledge, there have been two prospective studies that had a similar
research objective as our cohort. One was a nested case-control cohort of the 
Framingham offspring study [@Rhee2015a], which found that TAGFA with a lower
carbon chain and less double bonds (e.g. 14:0, 16:0) had higher OR for diabetes
after 12-years while higher carbon chain and more double bond TAGFA had a lower
OR for diabetes. This pattern of TAGFA with diabetes risk remained the same when
they examined HOMA-IR cross-sectionally at the baseline visit. The other study 
was a prospective cohort of males in Finland [@Lankinen2015a], of which they had
TAGFA data on 831 participants after 6-years from the baseline visit. This
cohort has similar outcomes as PROMISE, however, OGTT data was only available at
the 6-year visit. A beta-cell function measure was computed, but only included 
calculations up to 30 minutes of the OGTT. As with our results, they found a
larger effect size for insulin sensitivity compared to the beta-cell function.
The specific TAGFA that associated with the metabolic measures were similar 
between studies, except they did not find 
- The primary limit to these studies is the mainly small sample size and short
study duration. Two studies had larger sample sizes of 831 [@Lankinen2015a] and 
`r 189+189` [@Rhee2011a] and both were prospective cohorts. In addition, the
Framingham offspring study [@Rhee2011a] did not have data on beta-cell function 
while the Finnish cohort [@Lankinen2015a] used {{ how do I say this politely Tony? 
They're methods and article was ... questionable... }} simple statistical 
techniques to analysis the longitudinal data, which do not adequately take into
consideration auto-correlation of longitudinal values and the high dimensionality
of the TAGFA composition data structure.

[@Rhee2011a] fasting TAG status better as discriminating between DM case vs
control than 2hr-OGTT TAG
[@Kotronen2009a] (this wasn't studied, but discussed) higher hepatic DNL may
increase amount of 'shorter' chain FA (16:0, 14:0, etc.) into VLDL and hence
into circulation. So higher of these FA may indicate higher DNL -> problems with
liver function -> maybe hepatic IR -> cyclical?
[@Lee2015a] 16:1n-7 may be good marker of liver DNL.

Wilke2009a - contributions to DNL (e.g. 70% 16:0 to newly synth)
The four FA that cluster together on the PLS also appear to be the same FA that
make up most of DNL, especially in context of higher carb/refined carb in diet
[@Wilke2009a].

New things:

- No longitudinal study has examined all these TAGFA using detailed metabolic,
OGTT-derived measures. No study has used these statistical techniques, which
were designed with these types of data in mind, and as such allows appropriate
conclusions to be reached from this data.
- That 14-16 FA in the TAGFA fraction predict lower insulin sensitivity and that
this particular cluster is also generally observed with higher CHO intake.
