# Abstract

# Background

Hypertriglyceridemia is an extensively studied and well known factor involved in
the dysregulation of metabolic function and subsequent negative health outcomes [@Chehade2013a].
It is a component of the metabolic syndrome [@Alberti2009] and a strong risk factor for
cardiovascular disease [@DAgostino2004a], in addition to it's role in metabolic
dysfunction [@Verges2015a; @Kawano2013a]. The measurement of circulating 
triacylglcerides (TAG) is commonly done during routine clinical visits as part
of health assessment. However, clinically measured TAG is limited as it
represents all the types of fatty acids within the TAG fraction as a single
measure. Given the increasing appreciation for the role of the specific fatty
acid composition on health outcomes, for instance with differences in
associations of fatty acids within the PL lipid fraction [@Forouhi2014a; @Ma2015a] 
including an analysis from the PROMISE cohort [@Johnston2016a], there
are relatively few studies that have explored this area of research in the TAG
fraction.

The interaction between TAG and insulin sensitivity is complex and has 
components of a feedback system [@Verges2015a]. Greater resistance to insulin in both the liver
and muscle may result in greater production of TAG and secretion of lipoproteins
that transport TAG [@Yu2012a]. Likewise, greater TAGFA may contribute to 
metabolic dysfunction and lipotoxicity in various tissues, such as the 
beta-cells, and thus continuing the cycle [@Verges2015a]. Given the complexity and temporal
nature of the relationship, long term studies with multiple data collections are
paramount to better understanding the underlying biology and subsequent risk.

While several prospective studies have documented a prospective association of 
hypertriglyceridemia with incident type 2 diabetes 
[@Chien2008a; @DAgostino2004a; @Schulze2009a], there are limited longitudinal
studies that have examined the relationship between TAG and it's composition on
the pathophysiological factors underlying diabetes, particularly in regard to
beta-cell function. Our objective was to examine the longitudinal role of the
specific composition of the serum TAG fraction on OGTT-derived measures of
insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function compared to clinically measured TAG
in an Canadian population at risk for diabetes.

Recruitment for the baseline visit of the Prospective Metabolism and Islet Cell Evaluation (PROMISE) 
cohort took place between 2004-2006 in London and Toronto, 
Canada. Individuals were selected to participant if they met the eligibility 
criteria of having one or more risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
including obesity, hypertension, family history of diabetes, and/or a history of
gestational diabetes or birth of a macrosomic infant. A total of 736 individuals
attended the baseline visit. Subsequent examinations occurred every three years,
with three examination visits completed to date (2004-2006, 2007-2009, and
2010-2013). Participants are contacted annually by telephone. The current study
used data on participants who did not have diabetes at baseline, who
returned for one or more of the follow-up examinations, and who had samples
available for fatty acid measurements (n=477; see the CONSORT diagram in 
`r cite_sf('consort')`; a total of `r calc_n_for_visits()[1]` attended all three
visits). Metabolic characterization, anthropometric
measurements, and questionnaires on lifestyle and sociodemographics are
administered at each examination visit. Research ethics approval was obtained from
Mount Sinai Hospital and the University of Western Ontario, and all participants
provided written informed consent. Data collection methods were standardized
across the 2 centres and research nurses were centrally trained.

## Metabolic characterization

After 8-12 hours of fasting, participants completed a 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 
each examination visit, with blood samples taken at fasting, 30 min, and 2 hr 
post-glucose load. Samples were subsequently processed and frozen at -70°C.
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was measured using standard laboratory 
procedures. Cholesterol, HDL, and clinically-measured TAG 
were measured using Roche Modular's enzymatic colorimetric tests (Mississauga, 
ON). At the 6-year visit only, clinically-measured TAG was only quantified on a
subset of the participants (n=`r n_tag`). Both insulin and glucose were
measured from OGTT blood samples at fasting, 30 minute,
and 2 hour time points. Specific insulin was measured with the Elecsys 1010 
(Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) immunoassay analyzer and 
electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, which shows 0.05% cross-reactivity to 
intact human pro-insulin and the Des 31,32 circulating split form (Linco Res. 
Inc) and has a coefficient of variation (CV) of 9.3%. Glucose was determined 
using an enzymatic hexokinase (Roche Modular, Roche Diagnostics) with a 
detection range of 0.11 to 41.6 mmol/L and an inter-assay %CV of <1.1% and an
intra-assay %CV of < 1.9%.  All assays were performed at the Banting and Best
Diabetes Centre Core Lab at Mt Sinai Hospital. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG),
impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and diabetes were categorized using the 2006
WHO criteria [@WHO2006].

TAGFA composition was quantified using stored fasting serum samples from the 
baseline visit, which had been frozen at -70°C for 4-6 years and had not been 
exposed to any freeze-thaw cycles. Serum fatty acids have been documented to be 
stable at these temperatures for up to 10 years [@Matthan2010a]. A known amount 
of {{confirm with Richard the correct name}} heptadecanoic acid (17:0) was added as an internal
standard prior to extracting total lipids according to the method of Folch 
[@Folch1957a]. Each serum lipid fraction (non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), 
cholesteryl ester, phospholipid, and TAGFA) was isolated using thin layer 
chromatography. Fatty acid methyl esters were separated and quantified using a 
Varian-430 gas chromatograph (Varian, Lake Forest, CA, USA) equipped with a 
Varian Factor Four capillary column and a flame ionization detector. Fatty acid 
concentrations (nmol/ml) were calculated by proportional comparison of gas
chromatography peak areas to that of the internal standards [@Nishi2014a]. There
were 22 fatty acids measured in the TAGFA fraction. Given that each lipid
fraction differs in biology and given the complexity of the analyses, findings
for other lipid fractions in this cohort are reported separately (see ref
@Johnston2016a for the analysis of the phospholipid and cholesteryl ester
fractions). 
<!--and {{next citation}} for the analysis of the NEFA fraction).-->

## Anthropometrics and sociodemographics

Height, weight, and waist circumference (WC) were measured at all clinic 
examinations using standard procedures.  WC was measured at the natural waist, 
defined as the narrowest part of the torso between the umbilicus and the xiphoid
process. BMI was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by height (m) squared.
Questionnaires administered at each examination determined sociodemographics.
A version of the Modifiable Activity Questionnaire (MAQ) [@Kriska1990]
determined estimated physical activity. The MAQ collects information on leisure
and occupational activity, including intensity, frequency, and duration, over
the past year. Each reported activity from the MAQ was weighted by its
metabolic intensity allowing for the estimation of MET-hours per week [@Kriska1990].

## Variable calculation and statistical analysis

Insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function indices were computed using the OGTT 
glucose and insulin data. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using HOMA2-%S
[@Levy1998a] using the HOMA2 Calculator and the Insulin Sensitivity Index (ISI)
[@Matsuda1999]. HOMA largely reflects hepatic insulin resistance, while ISI
reflects whole-body insulin sensitivity [@AbdulGhani2007]. Beta-cell function
was assessed using the Insulinogenic Index [@Wareham1995] over HOMA-IR [@Matthews1985] (IGI/IR)
and the Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2) [@Retnakaran2009]. IGI/IR
is a measure of the first phase of insulin secretion while ISSI-2 is analogous to
the disposition index (but using OGTT values). Each index has been validated
against gold standard measures [@Matthews1985; @Hermans1999a; @Matsuda1999; @Retnakaran2009].
Specific formulas for each OGTT-derived measure can be found in the 
Supplementary Material.

The primary outcome variables for this analysis were HOMA2-%S, ISI, IGI/IR, and
ISSI-2, which were log-transformed for the statistical modeling. The primary
predictor variables for this analysis were 22 individual TAGFA included as either mole percent
(mol%) of the total fraction or as a concentration (nmol/mL). Clinically-measured
TAG was also included as a primary predictor to allow us to test the hypothesis
that specific TAGFA better predicted outcomes compared to clinical TAG. 
Pearson correlation coefficients were computed to assess the relationships of
individual TAGFA with other continuous variables. Correlations were also
computed for TAGFA against each other, followed by using hierarchical clustering
analysis to identify clusters within the correlation matrix of the TAGFA
composition.

Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models [@Zeger1986a] were used in the 
primary analysis to determine the longitudinal associations between the outcome 
variables and the predictor variables. The predictor variables and continuous 
covariates were scaled (mean-centered and standardized). Given the longitudinal 
design, an auto-regressive of order 1 (AR1) working correlation matrix was 
specified in the GEE model. Covariates to adjust for were selected based on the
previous literature, from directed acyclic graph [@Greenland1999a]
recommendations, and from quasi-likelihood information criteria (QIC). The final
GEE model was adjusted for time, waist circumference, baseline age, ethnicity,
sex, ALT, MET, and total NEFA. The TAGFA, total NEFA, sex, ethnicity, and
baseline age were classified as *time-independent* (held constant) as they were
measured only at the baseline visit or do not change throughout the study, while
the outcome variables and remaining covariates were set as *time-dependent*.
After transformations, the GEE estimates are interpreted as an expected percent 
difference in the outcome variable for every standard deviation (SD) increase in
the predictor variable given the covariates are held constant (including time). 
We also tested for an interaction with sex, ethnicity, or time by the predictor 
term for each outcome variable. See the Supplemental Methods for an expanded 
explanation of the GEE modeling analysis.

While GEE accounts for the longitudinal design of the data, this approach is 
limited in that it cannot analyze the inherent multivariate nature of the 
composition of the TAGFA fraction. To confirm the GEE results in a multivariate 
environment (i.e. all TAGFA analyzed collectively), partial least squares regression (PLS) was
used to identify the patterns of TAGFA composition against insulin sensitivity
and beta-cell function. For a detailed explanation of PLS see the Supplemental
Methods, but briefly, PLS is a technique that extracts latent structures
(clusters) underlying a set of predictor variables conditional on a response
variable(s) (i.e. the outcome variables). We determined the predictive strength
of modeling the TAGFA composition on metabolic function by using
cross-validation on the PLS model.

All analyses were performed using R `r getRversion()` [@Rbase], along with the R
packages geepack `r packageVersion('geepack')` for GEE [@Hoejsgaard2006a] and pls
`r packageVersion('pls')` for PLS. The R code and extra analyses for
this manuscript is available at {{code doi}}. Results were considered
statistically significance at p<0.05, after adjusting for multiple testing using
the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate [@Benjamini1995a]. STROBE was used
as a guideline for reporting [@Vandenbroucke2007b].

# Results

## Basic characteristics of the PROMISE cohort

`r cite_t('basic')` shows basic characteristics of the PROMISE cohort. The mean 
follow-up time was `r calc_followup_time()` years, where `r calc_pct_full_visits()`%
of participants attended all three visits. There were
`r female$npct` females and `r euro$npct` who had European-ancestry, with a mean
age in years of `r aide::ave_sd(ds0yr$Age)` and a mean BMI
of `r aide::ave_sd(ds0yr$BMI)` kg/m^2^. As expected from the study's eligibility criteria, the majority of
participants (`r fhd$npct`) had a family history of diabetes.
Between the baseline visit and the 6-year visit in this sample, insulin
sensitivity and beta-cell function measures had a significant median decline
between `r outcome_chg$chg` (p`r outcome_chg$p` from GEE; n=`r outcome_chg$n`). There 
were `r dys$dm` and `r dys$pre` incident cases of diabetes and
pre-diabetes (IFG and IGT), respectively, over the 6-years, of whom were excluded from later analyses. 

`r cite_f('tagfa')` shows the composition of each FA in the TAG fraction (see 
`r cite_st('tagfa')` for a tabular presentation of the values). 
Three TAGFA contributed `r format_rounding(sum(tagfa$pct))`% to the total 
TAG concentration: `r tagfa$c[1]`; `r tagfa$c[2]`; and, `r tagfa$c[3]`.
`r cite_f('heatmap')` shows a heatmap of the correlation of individual TAGFA with the
outcome variables and several basic characteristics.
As expected, nearly all TAGFA had very strong positive correlations (r=
`r fa_cor$rng$TAG`) with clinically-measured TAG and moderate positive 
correlations with WC (r=`r fa_cor$rng$Waist`). There was also moderate
negative correlations with HDL (r=`r fa_cor$rng$HDL`). For the outcome variables,
the correlations for the insulin sensitivity measures were generally higher 
(HOMA2-%S: r=`r fa_cor$rng['HOMA2-%S']`, ISI: r=`r fa_cor$rng$ISI`) than 
for the beta-cell function measures (all r<0.30). A heatmap of the correlations
of individual TAGFA using mol% with the basic characteristics is shown in 
`r cite_f('heatmap_mol')` and the inter-correlation matrix of the TAGFA fraction 
is shown in `r cite_f('heatmap_tagfa')`.

## Generalized estimating equation models

Results from the unadjusted GEE model are shown in `r cite_f('gee_unadj')`) and 
for the adjusted GEE model in `r cite_f('gee_adj')`. The majority of
associations with beta-cell function measures were attenuated after full model
adjustment, while nearly all associations with insulin sensitivity remained
significant for both mol% and nmol/mL results. Subsequent analysis revealed that
the attenuation with beta-cell function was due primarily to adjustment for
waist.

In analyses using TAGFA concentration values, nearly all TAGFA had a strong
negative association on HOMA2-%S and ISI (estimates ranging from
`r est1$outcome_b$rng[3]` and `r est1$outcome_b$rng[7]`, respectively), and a
few had strong negative associations with IGI/IR and ISSI-2 (estimates ranging 
from `r est1$outcome_b$rng[11]` and `r est1$outcome_b$rng[15]`, respectively).
In analyses using TAGFA mol% values, four TAGFA (14:0, 16:0, 14:1n-7, and 16:1n-7) had negative
associations with HOMA2-%S and ISI (between `r est1$outcome_b$rng[1]` and 
`r est1$outcome_b$rng[5]`%, respectively, lower insulin sensitivity for every SD
increase in the TAGFA), while several more TAGFA had positive associations with
HOMA2-%S and ISI (20:0, 18:1n-9, 20:1n-9, 22:1n-9, 18:2n-6, 20:2n-6, 20:4n-6,
and 22:5n-3) predicting between `r est1$outcome_b$rng[2]` and 
`r est1$outcome_b$rng[6]`%, respectively, higher insulin sensitivity for every
SD increase in the TAGFA. One TAGFA, 20:2n-6, had a very strong positive
association with the insulin sensitivity measures, with a `r est1$b_ci$est[1]`
to `r est1$b_ci$est[37]`% higher insulin sensitivity for every SD increase in 
20:2n-6. 

Both clinically-measured TAG and total TAGFA concentration had very strong
negative associations with all outcome variables. While there were a few
significant interactions by time in unadjusted models, after inclusion of
covariates in the model, these interactions were attenuated (data not
shown). There were no significant interactions by sex or ethnicity for any of
the TAGFA (data not shown). We ran sensitivity analyses to identify which
covariate attenuated the beta-cell function associations from the unadjusted
model. We found that including waist circumference in the model lead to the
attenuation of associations, shown in `r cite_sf("gee_adj_nowaist")`. A tabular
presentation of the GEE results is shown in `r cite_st("gee_unadj")` for
unadjusted models and `r cite_st("gee_adj")` for adjusted models.

## Clustering of TAGFA by metabolic measures

The PLS analysis corroborated the findings from the GEE models. 
The insulin sensitivity (`r cite_f('pls')`) PLS results showed a clustering 
of the fatty acids 14:0, 14:1n-7, 16:0, and 16:1n-7. These TAGFA loaded strongly
and negatively on HOMA2-%S and ISI, suggesting this cluster of TAGFA tracks
together with lower insulin sensitivity. The TAGFA 20:2n-6, 20:5n-3, 22:5n-3,
and 22:6n-3 loaded positively on both insulin sensitivity measures. No other
TAGFA loaded strongly. The PLS model for insulin sensitivity had good predictive
ability, with a high correlation between the predicted outcome values against
the actual values (HOMA2-%S: `r cor_pls_homa2$r_p`; ISI: `r cor_pls_isi$r_p`).

The beta-cell function PLS results showed clustering of similar fatty acids,
however there there was a low correlation (though significant at 
p`r cor_pls_igi$p`) between the predicted values and the actual values 
(r=`r cor_pls_igi$r` to `r cor_pls_issi2$r`), suggesting poor predictability.
Given the low predictability, only the insulin sensitivity measures are
presented. We used the extracted PLS scores as the predictor variable in the GEE
models and found negative associations of the first component on all outcome
variables, with the strongest association being with the insulin sensitivity
variables (beta=`r pls_gee$estimate[3]`, all p`r pls_gee$p.value[1]`; using PLS
scores constrained by ISI).

# Discussion

## Overall conclusion

We found that in an at-risk for diabetes Canadian population who were mainly female 
and of European ancestry, the specific TAGFA composition was strongly associated 
with insulin sensitivity and moderately associated with beta-cell function. In 
particular, TAGFA myristic acid (14:0), 7-tetradecenoic acid {{ confirm name }} 
(14:1n-7), palmitic acid (16:0), and palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7) all strongly and
negatively predicted lower insulin sensitivity. While most TAGFA were not
associated with beta-cell function, two fatty acids, palmitic acid (16:0) and *cis*-vaccenic acid (18:1n-7), were
associated negatively and positively, respectively, with both measures of 
beta-cell function. We also found that four TAGFA (14:0, 14:1n-7, 16:0, 16:1n-7)
clustered together, and this cluster also strongly predicted lower insulin sensitivity. 
These four fatty acids are also involved in the *de novo* lipogenesis (DNL) of refined and simple 
carbohydrates [@Hodson2008a; @Kawano2013a]. Our results, which are in agreement with the current literature,
suggest that higher activity of DNL (potentially through higher intakes of
simple carbohydrates) may increase the risk for diabetes, likely through
worsening insulin sensitivity.

## Interpretation and previous literature

To our knowledge, no longitudinal study to date has examined the role of the composition
of the TAGFA fraction on detailed OGTT-derived metabolic measures using advanced
{{another word? maybe 'appropriate'?}} statistical techniques designed to maximally
utilize the data. Two large prospective studies have been published that had
similar research objectives as the present analysis. One was a nested
case-control analysis (n=189 cases and n=189 controls) within the Framingham offspring
cohort [@Rhee2011a], which found that TAGFA composition characterized by a lower carbon chain
and fewer double bonds (e.g. 14:0, 16:0) had a higher risk for diabetes after 
12-years while higher carbon chain and more double bond TAGFA had a lower risk 
for diabetes. This pattern of TAGFA with diabetes risk remained the same when 
they examined HOMA-IR cross-sectionally at the baseline visit. The other study 
was a prospective cohort of males in Finland [@Lankinen2015a], for which 
TAGFA data were available for 831 participants after 6-years of follow-up. This 
cohort has similar outcomes as PROMISE, however, OGTT data was only available at
the 6-year visit. As with our results, they found a larger effect size for
insulin sensitivity compared to the beta-cell function. There were some
similarities in results between the present analysis and the Finnish study,
specifically for the saturated fatty acids, docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3),
eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3), and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6), though they did
not find any associations with 7-tetradecenoic acid (14:1n-7) and palmitoleic
acid (16:1n-7). Our study extends these findings by using multiple measurements
of metabolic function and using statistical techniques that adequately make use
of the longitudinal and high-dimensional dataset. In another study of a much
smaller (n=16) mostly female group [@Kotronen2009a], the authors report a
positive correlation between total esterified (of which TAG make up the
majority) 16:0, 16:1n-7, and 18:1n-9 with HOMA-IR, similar as our results except
for the 18:1n-9 finding.

Previous research has shown that carbohydrate intake increases DNL 
[@Hodson2008a; @Kawano2013a; @Harding2015a; @Hudgins2000a; @Parks1999a]. In
particular, DNL from refined or simple carbohydrate sources increases the 14 to
16 chain fatty acids as well as the 18 chain TAGFA. Several studies have shown a
link between higher estimated DNL and an increased risk for metabolic 
dysfunction [@Ma2015a; @Zong2013a; @Lankinen2015a; @Kroger2011a]. Our study
extends these findings by showing that TAGFA with 14 to 16 carbons clustered together and all
strongly predicted lower insulin sensitivity. While these fatty acids also had a
significant association with beta-cell function, the results were not as strong
as with the insulin sensitivity. However, while the DNL cluster had a strong
harmful association with insulin sensitivity when we include it in the GEE
models, the magnitude of the association was not as large as when using
clinically measured TAG, reinforcing that the total TAG concentration still more
strongly predicts metabolic dysfunction.

The link between higher DNL and increases in specific fatty acids has been
examined in several studies. Previous studies that have examined DNL have used
markers of estimated DNL, such as the ratio between 18:2n-6 to 16:0 or 16:1n-7
to 16:0 [@Hodson2008a; @Lankinen2015a; @Kroger2011a]. However, there are major
limitations to using these ratios as the fatty acids used in their calculation
can also be obtained from the diet in addition to being created through DNL
[@Hodson2008a]. A small, short feeding trial (n=24) was conducted to identify
fatty acids that most accurately reflected DNL, as potential biomarkers
[@Lee2015a]. The study found that palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7), directly measured
DNL using isotopes, and liver fat were all highly correlated with each other
(r>0.50), suggesting that 16:1n-7 may be a good biomarker for hepatic DNL. In
another small (n=14) feeding trial, meal type (high fat vs low fat) was tested
to determine its effect on DNL and TAGFA composition [@Wilke2009a]. The authors
reported that 14:0, 16:0, 16:1, and 18:2 were higher in the low fat (high
carbohydrate) group. These fatty acids are similar to the fatty acids we found
that clustered together using the PLS analysis, implicating these fatty acids as
indicative of a higher carbohydrate diet. A higher carbohydrate diet, 
particularly one characterized by a predominance of simple carbohydrates, may
lead to greater DNL in an attempt to control blood glucose, thus increasing hepatic
fat stores and consequently increasing the amount of TAGFA in circulation
[@Chehade2013a; @Verges2015a]. The higher concentration of circulating 14 and 16
carbon fatty acids may then expose tissues to greater lipotoxicity, for instance
from palmitic acid (16:0), which is well-known to have harmful effects on
tissues [@Riserus2008a; @Iggman2010a].

We found no interaction by time for any of the TAGFA on the metabolic outcomes.
Analyzing these biological processes longitudinally is challenging due to the
potential feedback mechanisms involved. For instance, while greater DNL may
promote muscle insulin resistance, the reverse may also be true
[@Flannery2012a]. Higher insulin resistance may encourage greater DNL to handle
the higher blood glucose. To illustrate this, in a weight loss intervention trial
(n=19 with TAGFA data), participants who lost weight over 33 weeks showed higher
insulin sensitivity and lower TAGFA composition indicative of lower DNL (less
14:0, 14:1, 16:0, 16:1, etc) [@Schwab2008a]. Given the complex biological
mechanisms and feedback loops involved, disentangling whether insulin
sensitivity influences TAGFA more strongly than TAGFA influencing insulin
sensitivity will require more complicated research designs and analyses. Our own
findings of no interaction by time with the TAGFA tentatively suggest that the
influence of either TAGFA or insulin resistance within the feedback loop may be
of relatively equal strength. 

Serum TAG are packaged into lipoproteins, particularly VLDL, by the liver. The
sources of fatty acids for TAG production during fasting are stored fatty acids
within the liver, circulating NEFA, and through DNL [@Barrows2006a]. Therefore, the
TAGFA composition reflects not just dietary intake but also stored fatty acids
from the adipose tissue and the DNL capacity of the individual. During fasting, a
large portion of fatty acids bound together as TAG are obtained from circulating
NEFA. A study examining this found that NEFA contributed 60-80% of newly synthesized
VLDL-TAG during fasting and ~40% during the fed state while dietary fatty acids
contributed ~25% to newly synthesized VLDL-TAG [@Barrows2006a]. In an analysis of the
serum NEFA fraction in the PROMISE cohort with the OGTT-derived outcomes
(under review), we found that higher total NEFA but not the specific
composition associated with lower beta-cell function and not with insulin 
resistance. While NEFA may contribute substantially to the TAG fraction, there 
may be something unique about the specific composition of the TAGFA fraction 
that may allow it to enter insulin sensitive tissues more easily than NEFA. It 
may be that VLDL receptors allow fatty acids to enter these tissue more easily
than NEFA bound to albumin or it may be due to the other influences on TAGFA 
composition such as dietary intake since circulating NEFA primarily come from
adipose tissue [@Verges2015a].

As with our previous analysis of the PL fatty acid fraction {{cite}}, we found
that cis-vaccenic acid strongly predicted higher insulin sensitivity and
beta-cell function. Likewise, in the TAGFA fraction we found a similar
association with cis-vaccenic acid. {{we can discuss to include more}}

{{ comment on comparing models with and without NEFA }} While
NEFA may be a mediating factor, we found that adjustment for it did not
{{confirm}} attenuate this association since TAGFA composition is also dictated
by other sources for DNL (e.g. recent meal, DNL from glucose stores, etc.).

While the NEFA fraction is much smaller than the TAG fraction, even though it
contributes substantially to the TAG fraction, the VLDL-TAG is not cleared
(lipolyzed) as much as chylomicron (which also contains a large amount of TAG)
and so has a higher half-life than NEFA, remaining in circulation longer {{hence
why there is bigger TAG pool vs NEFA}} {{cite?}}.

## Limitations

There are a few important limitations to our study. In addition to the
observational nature of the cohort, the biology underlying the interaction
between TAGFA, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity is complex and
multifaceted and as such there may be some residual confounding we were
unaware of or had not been able to adjust for. However, we have taken extensive,
empirically based precautions in identifying potential confounders and mediators
through the use of the DAG modeling, relying on previous literature, and through
QIC model fit comparison methods.

<!--
TAGFA can fluctuate substantially throughout the day and to control for this all
PROMISE participants came for their clinic visits in the morning in a fasted
state. Some of the inherent variability in TAGFA fluctuation can be managed by
standardizing the data collection time, though there may still be some
{{residual error? random error?}}.
[@Rhee2011a] fasting TAG status better as discriminating between DM case vs
control than 2hr-OGTT TAG
-->

TAGFA were only quantified at the baseline visit and as such we cannot
investigate whether there are concomitant changes in TAGFA and the metabolic
measures over time. However, to optimally use GEE to analyze the data and for
interpretation, we used the model to infer that a given value of TAGFA could
predict values of insulin sensitivity or beta-cell function over a 6 year
period. This in our view is a strength of our analysis, as it reduces the chance
of reverse causality given the tight integration of the glucose and fatty acid
metabolism pathways, as well as maximizes the specific usage of the GEE
modeling.

PLS is a well-established technique for constructing predictive models of high
dimensionality data structures (i.e. fatty acid composition), however a 
limitation is that the initial models analyzed through PLS and the final 
computed scores are not able to control for potential confounders and other 
effect modifiers. Likewise, PLS is not able to handle longitudinal data so only 
the baseline visit was used in the PLS analysis, though we analyze the extracted
scores using the GEE modeling to overcome this limitation. In light of these
limitations, we still observe concordant results between the PLS and GEE analyses.

Even with these limitations, our study has several notable strengths, including
the longitudinal design and the rigorous statistical techniques and methods
applied in analyzing the data. These statistical techniques take advantage of
the longitudinal data to allow appropriate investigation of temporal
relationships and are able to handle the multivariate nature of the data.
Lastly, our cohort contains highly detailed and comprehensive variable
measurements at each collection visit, as well as having both concentration and
mol% data for the fatty acids.

## Final conclusion

In conclusion, we found that a TAGFA composition indicative of higher DNL
(containing higher 14:0, 14:1n-7, 16:0, and 16:1n-7) associated strongly with lower
insulin sensitivity and moderately with lower beta-cell function. The fatty
acids that clustered together represent fatty acids created from DNL, which is
characteristic of higher simple carbohydrate (e.g. added sugar) intake. Our
results, which are congruent with current evidence, suggest that higher DNL,
likely due to greater intake of simple or refined carbohydrates, may increase the
risk of diabetes through worsening of insulin sensitivity.

# Supplemental Material

## Supplemental Methods: Statistical analysis

Generalized estimating equations (GEE) is a technique similar to mixed effects
modeling, except it calculates the marginal population estimates compared to the
subject-specific estimates in mixed effects models. GEE is well suited to and commonly
used in longitudinal cohort studies, especially given its capacity to handle
missed visits.

The working correlation matrix for the GEE analysis was chosen based on 
quasi-likelihood information criteria (QIC). The auto-regressive of order 1
(AR1) matrix was chosen for the GEE models as it had the best model fit accessed
using QIC, though other matrices (eg. exchangeable) had similar fit (data not
shown). 

For the confounders, they were chosen based on previous literature, from
directed acyclic graph (DAG) [@Greenland1999a] recommendations, and from
QIC. The DAG recommendations were obtained from using the DAGitty software
[@Textor2011a], http://dagitty.net/. See `r cite_sf('dag_is')` and 
`r cite_sf('dag_bcf')`) for the DAG model. See `r cite_st('qic')` for the
comparison of various models with different covariates using QIC. While the
final GEE model selected as best fitting differed between insulin sensitivity
and beta-cell function measures, the differences in the QIC values were less than 10
between many of the models, suggesting similar fit. As such, we selected the
model that had the fewest covariates and that had similar fit between the
outcome measures. In particular for NEFA, it is used substantially as a source
of fatty acids in hepatic TAG production [@Barrows2006a] and may be a strong
confounder.

No imputation was conducted on missing values. Prevalent cases of diabetes at
baseline and incident cases at follow-up were excluded from the GEE analysis. 
The resulting GEE beta estimates were exponentiated to allow the interpretation
as stated in the main methods.

PLS is a technique used for multivariate, high dimensionality datasets where
there is a potential or likely underlying structure to the data. Because it uses
a response variable (i.e. the outcome or y variable) when identifying the 
underlying structure it is known as a supervised statistical method, which gives
it greater predictive power when using the model against updated or new data.
PLS generates a number of components based on the number of variables provided.
We used internal 10-fold cross-validation to determine which components to
extract from the PLS analysis. Based on the internal cross-validation, the first
two components gave the highest amount of explained variance (data not shown),
of which we decided to use these two components in the final results.

The predictive capability of the PLS models were tested using cross-validation. 
The data set was randomly split in half into a training set and a testing set. 
After specifying the model on the training set, results were compared using the 
testing set to determine whether how predictive the model was given a new
dataset. Final results shown in the figures use the full dataset (rather than a
training or testing set). No prevalent diabetes cases were included in the PLS 
analysis.
