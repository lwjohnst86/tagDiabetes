TODO Reviewer responses and edits
TODO Include discussion of Yki-Jarvinen more recent paper on SC-SFA and NAFLD/NASH
DONE Remove sentence about DNL from abstract
TODO Temper discussion about DNL and related hypotheses.
    Page 13, 14. Look into Wei X et al. Nature 2016;539:294-298
TODO Expand on how DNL could mechanistically influence metabolic endpoints
DONE Add actual r values on page 9
TODO Include a short description on the combined analysis (and in context of full composition)
    - Only discuss in the responses, not manuscript.
DONE May need to add a comment to discussion about utility of using total TAG vs species
    - Not sure this is necessary and not even sure where to put this in the discussion
DONE Add brief discussion about sup figs 2 and 3, as well as about DAG in general
TODO Add more discussion to alternatives to then just DNL
DONE Do sensitivity analyses using carbs in model
    - No, won't do this. Not necessary and probably not a good idea anyway.
    - PLS with CHO as response. GEE with CHO in model
DONE In discussion, include limitation/strength of fasting vs fed with TGFA 
DONE Include a brief explanation of DAG in methods
TODO Include a discussion combining NEFA results with the TGFA results

TODO Resubmit to journal
